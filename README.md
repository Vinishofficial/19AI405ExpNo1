<h3>AIM:</h3>
<p>To find the PEAS description for the given AI problem and develop an AI agent.</p>
<h3>Theory</h3>
<h3>Plant Watering Agent:</h3>
<p>This agent monitors the soil moisture level of plants and waters them if the moisture is below a threshold (considered dry). The environment consists of multiple plants in different locations. The agent senses the moisture level of each plant and decides whether to water it. The agentâ€™s performance is measured by the number of plants properly watered, and each unnecessary movement reduces performance. Hence, the agent ensures plants are properly maintained.</p>

<h3>DESIGN STEPS</h3>
<h3>STEP 1: Identifying the input:</h3>
<p>Soil moisture level of plants, Location of each plant.</p>
<h3>STEP 2: Identifying the output:</h3>
<p>Water the plant if the soil is dry.</p>
<h3>STEP 3: Developing the PEAS description:</h3>
<p>PEAS description is developed by specifying the performance, environment, actuators, and sensors in the agent.</p>
<h3>STEP 4: Implementing the AI agent:</h3>
<p>Check the soil moisture of each plant and water the plant if dry.</p>
<h3>STEP 5:</h3>
<p>Measure the performance parameters: For each plant watered, performance is incremented; for each unnecessary movement, performance is decremented.</p>
